 * "Lenses are bidirectional transformations between pairs of connected structures. Asymmetric lenses
 * â€”where one of those two connected structures is taken to be primary â€”have been extensively studied.
 * Lenses were first proposed to solve the view- update problem of tree-like data structures by Foster et. al
 * and have also been applied to the construction of a relational database query language."
